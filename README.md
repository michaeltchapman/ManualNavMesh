# ManualNavMesh
A Sample Unreal Engine project for creating Detour NavMeshes manually

This repo acts as a reference and demonstration for the ideas presented in two blog posts [here](https://maladius.com/posts/manual_detour_navmeshes_1)
and [here](https://maladius.com/posts/manual_detour_navmeshes_2). A simple but large procedural terrain is created which will take Recast significant time
to process in order to facilitate pathfinding from one side to the other, while the debug actor has an editor callable function that will generate the
entire thing in approximately 100ms.


## Plugins

Uses [UnrealFastNoise](https://github.com/midgen/UnrealFastNoise) by midgen for smooth procedural generation of heights.

Tested with Unreal 4.22 and 4.25
